The purpose of this project is to showcase your frontend development skills and demonstrate familiarity with commonplace technologies such as user authentication, graphql, and e-commerce.

To make the project stand out, we're going to take a classic project — a Netflix-like clone — and give it a creative and fun spin: a VHS rental website that's haunted/corrupted.

## Division of Labor

- **********Matt Walter**********
    
    Matt is a junior software developer. He will act as the lead developer for this project and be responsible for implementing the lion’s share of the features and user stories.
    
- ****************************Addison Short****************************
    
    Addison Short is a senior software developer with 7+ years of industry experience. 
    
    They will perform code reviews of Matt‘s work and serve as his mentor for this project. They may implement some frontend user stories with @Matt but those contributions will be kept to a minimum.
    
    They will fill in the complimentary roles adjacent to the developer — acting as the product owner, designer, DevOps, and QA. They are responsible for scoping the work, preparing the tickets, rendering the design mocks for the product, and setting up backend APIs and services for the frontend to consume.
